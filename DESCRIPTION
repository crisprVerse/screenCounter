Title: Counting Reads in High-Throughput Sequencing Screens
Description: Provides functions for counting reads from high-throughput
    sequencing screen data (e.g., CRISPR, shRNA) to quantify barcode 
    abundance. Currently supports single barcodes in single- or paired-end
    data, and combinatorial barcodes in paired-end data.
